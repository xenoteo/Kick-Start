# Bus Routes
## Problem
Bucket is planning to make a very long journey across the countryside by bus. Her journey consists of **N** bus routes, numbered from 1 to **N** in the order she must take them. The buses themselves are very fast, but do not run often. The i-th bus route only runs every **X<sub>i</sub>** days.

More specifically, she can only take the i-th bus on day **X<sub>i</sub>**, 2**X<sub>i</sub>**, 3**X<sub>i</sub>** and so on. Since the buses are very fast, she can take multiple buses on the same day.

Bucket must finish her journey by day **D**, but she would like to start the journey as late as possible. What is the latest day she could take the first bus, and still finish her journey by day **D**?

It is guaranteed that it is possible for Bucket to finish her journey by day **D**.

## Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing the two integers **N** and **D**. Then, another line follows containing **N** integers, the i-th one is **X<sub>i</sub>**.

## Output
For each test case, output one line containing `Case #x: y`, where `x` is the test case number (starting from 1) and `y` is the latest day she could take the first bus, and still finish her journey by day **D**.

## Limits
Time limit: 10 seconds per test set.  
Memory limit: 1GB.  
1 ≤ **T** ≤ 100.  
1 ≤ **X<sub>i</sub>** ≤ D.  
1 ≤ **N** ≤ 1000.  
It is guaranteed that it is possible for Bucket to finish her journey by day **D**.  
1 ≤ **D** ≤ 10<sup>12</sup>.

## Sample
### Input
<pre>
3
3 10
3 7 2
4 100
11 10 5 50
1 1
1
</pre>

### Output
<pre>
Case #1: 6
Case #2: 99
Case #3: 1
</pre>

In Sample Case #1, there are **N** = 3 bus routes and Bucket must arrive by day **D** = 10. She could:
- Take the 1st bus on day 6 (**X<sub>1</sub>** = 3),
- Take the 2nd bus on day 7 (**X<sub>2</sub>** = 7) and
- Take the 3rd bus on day 8 (**X<sub>3</sub>** = 2).

In Sample Case #2, there are **N** = 4 bus routes and Bucket must arrive by day **D** = 100. She could:
- Take the 1st bus on day 99 (**X<sub>1</sub>** = 11),
- Take the 2nd bus on day 100 (**X<sub>2</sub>** = 10),
- Take the 3rd bus on day 100 (**X<sub>3</sub>** = 5) and
- Take the 4th bus on day 100 (**X<sub>4</sub>** = 50),

In Sample Case #3, there is **N** = 1 bus route and Bucket must arrive by day **D** = 1. She could:
Take the 1st bus on day 1 (**X<sub>1</sub>** = 1).
